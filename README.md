# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This program is a 2d Game engine made in C++ with SDL2. This program simply is an engine that allows creation of custom levels, enemies, and players. It has physics and a map system.

I always wanted to learn C++. I also wanted to work on a game. Severely underestimated the difficulty of this project.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
